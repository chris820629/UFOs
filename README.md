## Summary: 
1. The input window is case sensitive. If you input country or state in capital letters, the table will not be filtered correctly. Improvement can be adding regex feature to modify the inputs to lower cases to make it more user friendly. 
2. Without the filter button, user may not be fullly aware how to operate the filter feature. Improvement can be adding a "filter" button so user will have more context of how this feature works.
